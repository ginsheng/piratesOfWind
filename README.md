Remastered version of my first js game

Since this game was originally participating on js13k.
And the intention of that contest was making a game
capable of work on any browser and without any plug-ins.

All you need to play is to open index.html and you're done...
Just remember that css, js folders need to be there also.

Thats all for now.

Thank you.
